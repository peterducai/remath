# Tensors

1. All scalars are not tensors, although all tensors of rank 0 are scalars (see below).
2. All vectors are not tensors, although all tensors of rank 1 are vectors (see below).
3. All dyads or matrices are not tensors, although all tensors of rank 2 are dyads or matrices.
4. We have examined, in some detail, properties and operating rules for scalars, vectors, dyads, and matrices.
5. We now extend these rules to tensors per se. We assert that:
6. Tensors can be multiplied by other tensors to form new tensors.
7. The product of a tensor and a scalar (tensor of rank 0) is commutative.
8. The pre-multiplication of a given tensor by another tensor produces a different result from post-multiplication; i.e., tensor multiplication in general is not commutative.
9. The rank of a new tensor formed by the product of two other tensors is the sum of their individual ranks.
10. The inner product of a tensor and a vector or of two tensors is not commutative.
11. The rank of a new tensor formed by the inner product of two other tensors is the sum of their individual ranks minus 2.
12. A tensor of rank n in three-dimensional space has 3n  components.
