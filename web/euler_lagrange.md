# Eulerâ€“Lagrange equation

This equation is used to analyse everything from the shape of a soap bubble to the trajectory of a rocket around a black hole.

More than just an equation, it's actually a recipe to generate an infinite variety of possible physical laws

"The way that all classical physics can be expressed and understood within a single framework like that helps reveal deep links between seemingly different phenomena."
