C. Provide a solution in terms of human actions to confirm if the task is within the scope of automation through AI.
To assist in outlining the steps needed to achieve our final goal, outline the AI-less process that we are trying to automate with Machine Learning. Provide as much detail as possible.

D. Outline a path to operationalization.
AI Ops Projects should have an operationalized end point in mind from the onset. Briefly describe how you see the tool produced by this project being used by the end user beyond a jupyter notebook or POC. If possible, be specific and call out the relevant technologies (especially if they are aligned with leveraging existing elements of ODH)
