// The CNOT gate, or Controlled-NOT gate, is a two-qubit gate
// that is used to create entanglement between qubits.
// The CNOT gate operates on two qubits, one of which is called
// the control qubit and the other is called the target qubit.
// If the control qubit is in state 1, then the CNOT gate flips the state of the target qubit.
